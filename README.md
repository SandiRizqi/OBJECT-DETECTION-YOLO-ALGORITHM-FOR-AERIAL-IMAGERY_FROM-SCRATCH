# OBJECT-DETECTION-YOLO-ALGORITHM-FOR-AERIAL-IMAGERY
This project is implementation of Object detection YOLO algorithm to detect object in aerial imagery or satellite imagery data

To implement this project you need to meke envirinment and install some essential packages:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- slidingwindow
- matplotlib
- shapely

or just install from Requirement.txt by pip install -r Requirement.txt
this project also able to run in google colab



MAKE SAMPLES :
- Just run make_chip_samples.py to your imagery data to make sample that you can annotate
- to make and annotate you samples you need to install Labelimg
- Annotate you sample and save in VOC format
